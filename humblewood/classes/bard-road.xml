            <p class="indent">Not an officially recognized college, the College of the Road represents the personal and eclectic sets of skills, knowledge, and techniques a wandering bard picks up along their journey. As inveterate jacks-of-all-trades, bards possess a variety of aptitudes in combat, magecraft, and general know-how, making them particularly well suited to learning a variety of different skills. It often happens that while traveling, a bard winds up sharing their campfire with a motley assortment of wandering adventurers who may impart valuable lessons in exchange for a lively song or a well-told tale. Compared to students of other Bard Colleges, a special kind of sensibility is important for the College of the Road. How effectively a bard of this College can apply what they have learned depends on their understanding and insight. The College of the Road is sometimes a harsh teacher, but bards who follow this path often find themselves rewarded with a diverse array of useful tricks and tactics. Those who underestimate a bard from the College of the Road soon find that these “graduates” are full of surprises.</p>

            <p class="indent">At 3rd level you already have several memorable experiences from your life on the road. You learn two Traveler’s Tricks of your choice (see Traveler’s Trick Options).</p>
            <p class="indent">These Traveler’s Tricks represent skills, techniques, and useful pieces of knowledge picked up along the way. Each one requires you to expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration, and takes a bonus action to use unless otherwise specified.</p>
            <p class="indent">Unlike traditional bard abilities which rely on skill or panache to be properly executed, the greatest asset for picking up tricks along the road is common sense and an openness to learning new ideas. Wisdom affects how powerful your traveler’s tricks are, as well as how hard they are to counter. If an option requires a saving throw, your Traveler’s Trick save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 6th level and at 14th level you learn an additional Traveler’s Trick.</p>

        <description>
            <p class="indent">An experienced paladin instructed you in the basics of combat triage. When you or an ally within 5 feet of you receives healing of any kind, you may use your reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and provide extra healing equal to the number on the Bardic Inspiration die roll + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You must have at least one hand free in order to quickly staunch the target's wound.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 6th level, you have learned to identify a selection of useful herbs that you can carry with you. When providing additional healing with this trick you may also remove the poisoned or paralyzed condition from the target.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 14th level, you have developed a true knack for emergency triage. You may additionally remove a single disease affecting the target of this ability.</p>

            <p class="indent">A wise monk was happy to share the basic form of the jab and weave. When you take the attack action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to quickly execute two unarmed strikes against one or more creatures you could target.

            <p class="indent">A patient druid shared the secrets of forest magic with you. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration as an action to conjure a forest guardian spirit in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you. The guardian spirit is Large, and takes the appearance of a spectral predatory cat. Any enemy that moves into or leaves a space adjacent to the guardian spirit must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking magical slashing damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die on a failure. The guardian spirit will remain for as long as you concentrate on it, up to 10 minutes.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 6th level, your bond with the guardian spirit grows even deeper. Any creature dealt damage by your guardian spirit has their speed reduced to 0 for the rest of the turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 14th level, any Large or smaller creature who has their speed reduced to 0 by the guardian spirit is restrained for as long as you maintain your concentration, as your guardian spirit pins them in place. The target can break free by spending an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your Traveler's Trick save DC.</p>
