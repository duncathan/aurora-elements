# aurora-elements
A Humblewood implementation for [Aurora Builder](https://aurorabuilder.com). 

## Installation
First, install [AuroraLegacy](https://github.com/AuroraLegacy/elements), as these files were built with at least the `core` from AuroraLegacy as a prerequisite.

Next, add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duncathan/aurora-elements/main/humblewood.index` as an index file in Aurora, have it download the content for you, and restart the app. You should be good to go!
